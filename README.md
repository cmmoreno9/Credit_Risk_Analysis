# Credit Risk Analysis

Apply machine learning tecniques to identify high and low credit risk. Need to employ a multitude of techniques to train and evaluate the models needed for credit risk analysis. Interpretation will take place in utilizing  decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.

# Results 

## Naive Random Oversampling

- Precision high for low-risk, but is inadequate for high-risk
- Balanced accuracy = ~ 0.674
- Recall = .74/.61 

## SMOTE Oversampling 
- Precision high for low-risk, but is inadequate for high-risk
- Balanced accuracy = ~ 0.662
- Recall = .63/.69

## Undersampling
- Precision high for low-risk, but is inadequate for high-risk
- Balanced accuracy =  ~ 0.545
- Recall = .69/.40 

## Combination (Over & Under Sampling)
- Precision high for low-risk, but is inadequate for high-risk
- Balanced accuracy = ~ 0.645
- Recall = 0.72/0.57
